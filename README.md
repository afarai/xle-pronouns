This repository contains the code that was modified for the implementation of anaphoric pronouns in XLE+Glue introduced in 
'Handling Monotonic and Non-monotonic Semantic Content in XLE+Glue: Unraveling the Complexity of Anaphoric Mechanisms', 
the master's thesis submitted to the University of Konstanz by Astrid Farai Grenzd√∂rffer in March 2024.

The modified Boxer files consist of 'lambdaDRT.pl' and the 'boxer' folder.

The modified grammar is 'glue-basic-drt-pron.lfg.glue'.

'testsuiteMA.lfg' contains the test sentences (also seen in Appendix A).


XLE+Glue can be accessed via https://github.com/Mmaz1988/xleplusglue.
